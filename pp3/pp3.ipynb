    "- Randomize a sequence preserving its k-mer word content (i.e., 1 letter, 2-letter, 3-letter, ...). This may be solved simply using sampling with or without replacement, but the k-mer content of the randomized sequence will not exactly match the original sequence. A more complicated approach is to provide an exact solution using Euler’s method.\n",
    "- input and output in FastA format. Your program should work for any alphanumeric letter sequence, but especially DNA and protein alphabets.\n",
    "- k-mer should be selectable in range 1 to 6 (or more)\n",
    "- Additional output should show original and randomized k-mer word content\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "This project implements two ways to randomize a sequence:\n",
    "1. **Sampling randomization (approximate)**: shuffle characters in the sequence.\n",
    "    - Preserves 1-mer composition exactly (same letters), but generally does not preserve k-mers for k ≥ 2.\n",
    "2. **Exact k-mer preserving randomization (Euler / De Bruijn graph)**: build a **De Bruijn graph** from k-mers and **generate an Eulerian trail/circuit**.\n",
    "    - Guarantees all k-mer counts match **exactly for k ≥ 2** (same multiset of k-mers), while still producing a randomized sequence by randomizing edge order."

    "## Problem Solving Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "To preserve the k-mer content, I first think of the difficulty of the problem depends on k. For k = 1, preserving k-mers only requires maintaining the overall letter composition of the sequence, which can be achieved by randomly shuffling characters. However, for k ≥ 2, simple shuffling disrupts local sequence order and therefore changes k-mer counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, I implemented two methods. The first is a **sampling-based randomization** that shuffles characters and serves as a baseline, illustrating that higher-order k-mer structure is not preserved. The second is an **exact method based on a De Bruijn graph representation of overlapping k-mers**. In this graph, each k-mer corresponds to a directed edge, and *an Eulerian traversal uses every edge exactly once*, guaranteeing that all k-mer counts are preserved. Randomness is introduced by shuffling edge traversal order, producing different valid sequences with identical k-mer content."

    "In contrast, using the Euler/De Bruijn exact randomization method, the program reports `Exact k-mer match (Euler)? True`, and **the top k-mers and their counts match the original k-mer frequency table**, confirming that all observed k-mers are preserved exactly. For readability, the program prints only the first 60 characters of each randomized sequence, while all k-mer counting and comparisons are computed using the full sequences."

    "## Discussion/Conclusion\n",
    "This project shows that a simple shuffle based randomization is a useful baseline because it preserves 1-mer composition, but it does not preserve k-mer word content for k ≥ 2 since shuffling destroys local adjacency relationships between characters. The exact method solves this by converting the sequence’s k-mers into a De Bruijn graph where each k-mer corresponds to a directed edge between its *(k−1)-mer prefix* and *suffix*; an Eulerian traversal visits every edge exactly once, which guarantees that the output contains the same multiset of k-mers as the input. Randomness is introduced by shuffling adjacency lists before traversal, producing different valid randomized sequences while maintaining identical k-mer counts. **Therefore, the sampling approach provides approximate randomization, while the Eulerian approach meets the project requirement of exact k-mer preservation.**\n"
